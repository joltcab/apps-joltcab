The AI engineer's work on the JoltCab User App has progressed significantly from initial setup to implementing advanced features and extensive bug fixing. The trajectory begins with the AI confirming the creation of core Fase 3 screens (chat, SOS, share trip, navigation) and associated components, alongside fixing a user persistence issue. A major part of the conversation involved debugging non-functional Google Maps autocompletion and display, where the AI correctly identified backend API key misconfiguration and implemented a frontend fallback. Accessibility warnings () in modals were also addressed. Subsequently, the user introduced requirements for WhatsApp ride requests, dynamic AI pricing, and AI support chat. The AI began integrating these, initially using new backend endpoints and then refactoring for a modular AI provider architecture using a Strategy pattern, as of the last message. The process involved continuous iterative debugging and verification against user feedback, highlighting the AI's problem-solving capabilities in a complex full-stack environment.

<product_requirements>
The JoltCab project targets two mobile apps: a User App and a Provider App. The User App, the current focus, enables ride booking, real-time tracking, payments, ratings, trip history, wallet management, profile settings, onboarding, and authentication. It was initially scoped for 12 screens with a full backend (authentication, trip management, Stripe, Socket.IO).

Recent development, currently in implementation, expands features:
1.  **Negotiation System**: Users propose prices, drivers offer, users accept.
2.  **Order by WhatsApp**: Generate pre-filled WhatsApp messages for ride requests.
3.  **Real-time Statistics**: Display user savings, trips, rating, wallet balance.
4.  **Chat in Real-time**: Socket.IO-based chat.
5.  **SOS Button**: Emergency functionality.
6.  **Share Trip**: Share trip details via WhatsApp/SMS.
7.  **In-app Navigation**: Integration with Waze/Google Maps.
8.  **AI Services**: Dynamic pricing, AI support chat.

The backend is , using legacy endpoints for auth and new ones for advanced features, including  for AI/WhatsApp. Firebase handles push notifications and data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on integrating AI services (dynamic pricing, AI support chat) and WhatsApp booking into the JoltCab User App. After receiving detailed endpoint information for  services, the AI began implementing these integrations.

The  specifically involved:
1.  **Creating AI Service**: A new file  was created to encapsulate API calls for AI and WhatsApp.
2.  **Creating AI Support Chat Component**: A new component  was created to provide a dedicated UI for the AI chat.
3.  **Updating  for Emergent IA**: The  was updated to utilize the new  endpoints (e.g., ).
4.  **Updating **: The component was updated to correctly use the  method from the newly configured .
5.  **Refactoring for Modularity**: The user requested an optional, modular approach for AI providers. The AI started implementing a Strategy pattern by creating:
    *   : An interface defining the contract for AI providers.
    *   : An implementation of  for the  module.

The work is focused on making the AI integration flexible and ready for future alternative AI providers, with the current implementation targeting the  module.

<optional_next_step>
Continue creating the modular AI architecture by implementing an alternative AI provider example and updating the main AI service to use this new pattern.
