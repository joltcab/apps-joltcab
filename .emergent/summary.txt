The AI engineer successfully established the JoltCab mobile application, starting from an initial detailed product description and evolving through user clarifications. Initially, the focus was on the User App, including a full backend (FastAPI, then ) and frontend build (Expo, React Native, TypeScript). Key milestones involved setting up authentication, Google Maps, Stripe integration, and real-time tracking via Socket.IO. The process included iterative debugging, such as resolving  web issues, fixing onboarding navigation, and adapting to the  backend's legacy API structure. Currently, the project is in Fase 3, implementing advanced features like chat, SOS, trip sharing, and navigation, with initial components and state management being set up for these. The AI demonstrated adaptability in shifting from an internal FastAPI backend to an external  API based on user input.

<product_requirements>
The JoltCab project encompasses two mobile applications: a User App and a Provider App. The **User App** facilitates ride booking, real-time tracking, payment, rating, trip history, wallet management, profile settings, and includes onboarding and authentication. The **Provider App** enables drivers to manage trips, view requests, track earnings, and maintain their profile.

The initial scope focused on building the **User App** first, including 12 screens (Splash, Onboarding, Login, Register, Home, BookRide, TripTracking, TripRating, History, Wallet, Profile, Settings) and a full backend API for authentication, trip management, Stripe payments, and Socket.IO real-time services.

Recent enhancements, currently in implementation phases, include:
1.  **Negotiation System**: Users suggest prices, drivers offer, user accepts best offer.
2.  **Order by WhatsApp**: Generate pre-filled WhatsApp messages for ride requests.
3.  **Real-time Statistics**: Display user savings, trips, rating, and wallet balance.
4.  **Chat in Real-time**: Socket.IO-based chat.
5.  **SOS Button**: Emergency functionality.
6.  **Share Trip**: Share trip details via WhatsApp/SMS.
7.  **In-app Navigation**: Integration with Waze/Google Maps.

The backend infrastructure is provided by , utilizing specific legacy endpoints for authentication and new endpoints for negotiation, chat, and other features. Firebase is used for push notifications and Firestore for ride/user data.

The project is structured with a  root, containing  (the current focus) and .
The  directory structure is as follows:



**Key Files and Changes:**
-   : Updated to switch between  (development) and  (production) for  and . Forced to production to address caching issues.
-   : Modified to use the new  legacy endpoints (, , etc.) and  method for all requests.
-   : Updated to connect to  for real-time communication, particularly for  events.
-   : Updated to use 's legacy  and  endpoints, adjusting payload structure (e.g., , , , ) and implementing login via both email and phone.
-   : Configured with Google Maps API keys for iOS and Android, and Firebase settings.
-   : Updated to conditionally render maps for web and include  components for user statistics.
-   : Enhanced with address search, action buttons, and a placeholder for map components. It's currently being updated to include negotiation options and WhatsApp integration.
-   : Fixed the Next button functionality to correctly advance through onboarding screens.
-   : Updated to capture  and  separately for the  API.
-   , , : Updated to display , , and  consistent with the  user data structure. Fixed an error where  could be undefined.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on Fase 3 which focuses on implementing advanced features for the JoltCab User App. This phase includes real-time chat, SOS functionality, trip sharing, and in-app navigation.

Current progress in Fase 3:
1.  **Dependencies Installation**:  and  were installed.
2.  **Core Components and Stores Creation**:
    *   : Created for managing chat state.
    *   : Initial chat screen.
    *   : Initial SOS screen.
    *   : Initial trip sharing screen.
    *   : Initial in-app navigation screen.
    *   : Created.
    *   , , , , : These UI components for Fase 3 were created.
3.  **Bug Fix**: An  was encountered in  when  was  while trying to access . This error has been fixed.

The app is configured to use  for API calls and Socket.IO for real-time features.
